  Post-implementation completion workflow for Spec-backed Plans. Use after spec-implement

  Triggers only with an active Spec-backed Plan after spec-implement completes, including when
  the user says "finish", "done", or "complete" in that context.

# Spec Finish

Post-implementation workflow: simplify → synchronize docs → validate → review → prepare PR.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, verify:
1. All Spec-backed Plan tasks are complete
2. Working directory has no unresolved staged or unstaged changes
3. Tests pass

If not complete, go back to `spec-implement`.

---

## Step 1: Compare Scope and Simplify

Compare the implementation with the original behavior and user goal before documentation or
validation. Remove unrequested scope, duplicate concepts, one-consumer abstractions, and custom
machinery that replaces sufficient platform behavior.

If the implementation faithfully follows an unnecessarily large design, stop and return to
`spec-plan`. Get approval for the smaller plan before continuing.

Update the finished SDD to describe the smaller result. Replace rejected architecture in the
normative design and plan instead of preserving it as precedent; mention it only as a rejected
alternative when that history remains useful.

---

## Step 2: Update Documentation

Check whether README, API documentation, or changelog updates are needed. Make and commit any
necessary documentation changes through **code-commit** before final validation.

---

## Step 3: Validate

Run validation checks.

### Test Suite
```bash
npm test
# or
pytest
# or
cargo test
```

### Type Check
```bash
npm run typecheck
# or
python -m mypy
# or
cargo check
```

### Lint
```bash
npm run lint
# or
ruff check .
# or
cargo clippy
```

### Build
```bash
npm run build
# or
go build ./...
```

**If any fail:** Return to `spec-implement` to fix.

**If all pass:** Proceed.

---

## Step 4: Review

Invoke the installed **code-review** skill through the harness's skill mechanism for one
comprehensive review of the final change.

### What to Review
- All changed files since the intended base branch's merge base
- Test coverage
- Documentation updates
- No debug code left

### If code-review finds issues
- Minor fixes may be made here, then re-validated and reviewed.
- Blocking or scope-changing fixes return to `spec-implement`.

---

## Step 5: Prepare Commits

Review current commits with `git log --oneline`. Use **code-commit** for any uncommitted work.
Do not rewrite history by default. If a rebase would materially improve an unpublished stack,
show the affected range and ask for separate approval before rebasing.

---

## Step 6: Prepare the PR

Steps 1-5 (simplification, documentation, validation, review, commits) must all be complete
before proceeding. **If code-review found blocking or scope-changing issues, stop and return
to spec-implement to fix them. Do not proceed to Step 6b.**

### Step 6a: Present Completion Summary

Before creating the PR, present a summary to the human:

```
## Completion Summary

**Feature:** [name]
**Tests:** [passed/failed]
**Type Check:** [passed/failed]
**Lint:** [passed/failed]
**Review:** [passed/issues found]
**Commits:** [N commits in stack]
**Ready for PR:** [yes/no]
```

### Step 6b: Invoke code-pull-request

Only when the summary shows **Ready for PR: yes**, invoke the
[code-pull-request](../code-pull-request/SKILL.md) skill to create the PR. It
detects the platform (GitHub/GitLab), checks for an existing PR, finds a
template, generates the body from commits, and opens the PR via `gh` or `glab`.

### Handoff

> "Implementation complete. [N] commits are ready. PR package ready for approval."

---

## Integration

This skill orchestrates other skills:

- Invokes code-review for quality check
- Invokes code-pull-request as the final step to open the PR

---

## When NOT to Use

- If implementation is still in progress, use spec-implement
- If tests are failing, go back to spec-implement
- If review found blocking or scope-changing issues, go back to spec-implement
- If the implementation follows an unnecessarily large design, go back to spec-plan
